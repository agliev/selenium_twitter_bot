# selenium_twitter_bot
Selemium bot for following, making retwits and likes in Twitter if you dont want to work with official API. 

 The rejection of the twitter api is caused by the need to perform a small number of simple operations (like, retweet, subscribe) on multiple accounts.
 For that it is necessary to register a corresponding number of twitter bots, which is very time-consuming. So I decided to use selenium (post-requests 
 are rejected because of the impossibility of automating cookies receipt)
